This &GAP; package provides methods for computing with finite-index subgroups of
the modular groups <M>SL_2(&ZZ;)</M> and <M>PSL_2(&ZZ;)</M>. This includes,
but is not limited to, computation of the generalized level, index or cusp widths.
It also implements algorithms described in <Cite Key="hsu_1996"/> and
<Cite Key="hamilton_loeffler_2014"/> for testing if a given group is a congruence
subgroup. Hence it differs from the <URL Text="Congruence">https://gap-packages.github.io/congruence/</URL>
package <Cite Key="congruence_package"/>, which can be used - among other things - to construct canonical congruence
subgroups of <M>SL_2(&ZZ;)</M>.

A convenient way to represent finite-index subgroups of <M>SL_2(&ZZ;)</M> is by
specifying the action of generator matrices of <M>SL_2(&ZZ;)</M> on the right
cosets by right multiplication. For example, one could choose the generators

and represent a subgroup as a tuple of transitive permutations
<M>(\sigma_S,\sigma_T)</M> describing the action of <M>S</M> and <M>T</M>.
This is exactly the way this package internally treats such subgroups. We use
the convention that <M>1</M> corresponds to the coset of the identity matrix.
Note that such a representation as a tuple of permutations is only unique up to
relabelling of the cosets, i.e. up to simultaneous conjugation (fixing the
<M>1</M> coset by our convention).
