- make modular subgroup object immutable
- add references to papers
- cusp object?
- more examples in documentation
- tests
- implement mÃ¶bius transformations as group action?
- implement alternative method for calculating cusps for common congruence subgroups?
- smarter coset representative computation?
- implement 'Cusps' for 'IsModularSubgroup and HasCuspsRedundant' (-> use group actions and orbits?)
- 'Print' functionality for the ModularSubgroup object
